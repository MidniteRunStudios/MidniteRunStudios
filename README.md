# MidniteRun Studios

We are **MidniteRun Studios**, an independent, employee-owned collective of creators.  
Since 2011, we’ve been carving out interactive experiences that don’t play nice with convention.  
We train, research, explore, and share knowledge — whether it’s about code, art, or something far outside software.  
We’re not here to fit in. We’re here to make an impression.

## 🎯 Mission

A supportive community, owned by its people.  
We build, we break, we teach, we learn.  
We pass skills around like mixtapes — software, art, philosophy, whatever.  
Our work is punk at heart: raw, collaborative, and unapologetic.

## 🗡️ Scars of Kalakar

Our flagship saga, in development since 2011.  
A continent torn apart by immortals and the fallout of bombs, wars, slavery, and capitalism.  
It’s about damage — physical, emotional, mental — and the marks left behind.  
Kalakar bleeds, and we’re telling its story.

## 🌟 One-Shot Experiences

Not everything needs to be epic. Sometimes it’s quick, loud, and messy.  
We’ve built:  
- Shoot-em-up arcade chaos  
- Point-and-click adventures  
- A webcomic called **The What If Zone** (2006)  

Each one is a chance to experiment, to burn fast and bright.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The Crew

- **TrashProfessor** — lead artist, programmer, writer, researcher  
- **Luna** — playtester, 3D artist  
- **Mumkemike** — writer, playtester, comic relief  
- **Nikolai** — #1 fan, artist, playtester  

We’re small, scrappy, and stubborn. That’s the point.

## 🚀 Roadmap

We don’t do roadmaps.  
We work like Valve: **it’s done when it’s done.**  
No deadlines. No false promises. Just creation.
